                    <h3 > Description of Tools Used </h3> 
                    <p > For this Project, we used Vue as our client-side framework. We used Skeleton, a CSS framework, to style the things
                      on our page. We used the Leaflet api to get our map and markers, the nominatim api to convert from address to lat and long,
                      and our Restful api we created to access the information about crimes that you see in the table. For our Restful api, we used
                      node js, express, cors, json2xml, bodyParser, and sqlite3.
                    </p>
